# Student Research Assistant: November 2019 - Present, Weizenbaum Institute
I joined [research group 17](https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/en/research/rg17/) of the Weizenbaum Institute in November 2019 as a research assistant.
The interdisciplinary group conducts research on topics such as blockchain-based systems and trust in distributed systems.

I had the opportunity to put my theoretic knowledge on computer networks and distributed systems from my studies into practice.
I mainly support the research groupâ€™s work via programming (see [projects section](projects)) and documentation of results (which are sometimes published).

Since joining the team, I have learnt a lot on a technical level but also in terms of soft skills.

# Student Research Assistant: February 2019 - November 2020, HU Berlin
In February 2019, I begun my first job at Humboldt University in Berlin as a research assistant (where I later pursued my Master's).
I was part of the [Modelling and Analysis of Complex Networks](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/de/forschung/gebiete/macsy) group until November 2020.
The group's research was strongly focused on algorithmic engineering.

My main tasks included programming new features in C++ and Python (see NetworKit under [projects](projects/)) and writing tutorials using Jupyter Notebooks.

Besides gaining knowledge on graphs and algorithms, this was the first time I used `git` in the 'real world', i.e. not just for personal use or with 1-2 classmates where a force push usually fixed everything.
I learned about forks, pull requests, rebasing - a lot of my `git` knowledge comes from that time.
Although I had coded in C++ previously - and enjoyed doing so - I also learned a lot about writing readable, production C++ code used in production software.

# Summer 2018/ 2019
My professional journey in computer science begun at some point during my undergraduate studies (Oct. 2015 - Sept. 2019) when I got my first job as a TA.
I tutored Bachelor degree students in an undergraduate-level operating systems course for 2 semesters until I graduated.
