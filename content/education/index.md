I graduated high school in 2014 with 'Abitur' - the German equivalent of A levels - from the German School in Nairobi.

I began my Bachelor's in Computer Science in the Autumn of 2015 at the [Brandenburg University of Technology](https://b-tu.de/) in Cottbus, Germany.
Besides an all-round overview of computer science, the course included theoretical foundations such as mathematics and theoretical computer science.
During my studies, I discovered my interest for computer networks, distributed systems and cybersecurity.
In my Bachelor's thesis, I conceptualised a 'reliable' protocol for wireless sensor networks which I evaluated using simulations in OMNeT++ and on MSP 430 microcontrollers.

I am now working towards my Master's degree at the Humboldt University of Berlin and expect to graduate in Mid 2022.
My studies focus heavily on distributed systems and computer networks.
I am now working on my thesis which studies incentives in different blockchain-based consensus schemes
