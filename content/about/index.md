Hi, I am Charmaine (she/her) and I am happy you made you way here - thanks!
I grew up in the East African metropolis Nairobi with two mother tongues - English and Swahili.
At the age of about 12, I started learning German which I am now fluent in; I wish I was fluent in more languages though.

I am a Computer Scientist by profession and desire.
I am currently about to graduate with my Master's from the Humboldt University in Berlin and curious/nervous but mostly excited to see what the future holds.

I am also a wannabe baker and often spend my free time trying out new recipes.
Oftentimes I succeed, but sometimes things go wrong.
I commiserating with my family who has to taste my pastries but my failed endeavours always encourage me to keep practising and improve the next time.
You can find a selection of my breads/ pastries in the [gallery](gallery).

I am not an athletic person, e.g. I've had countless failed attempts at jogging, but I actually play tennis.
This is something I've done since my childhood, on and off, and recently picked up again.
Hanging out at the courts with my *identical twin sister* during the hot Berlin summers is quite fun.
