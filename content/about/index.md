Hi, I am Charmaine (she/her) and I am happy you made your way here - thanks!
I grew up in the East African metropolis Nairobi with two mother tongues - English and Swahili.
At the age of about 12, I started learning German which I am now fluent in.

I am a Computer Scientist by profession.
I am about to graduate with my Master's from the Humboldt University in Berlin and curious/nervous but mostly excited to see what the future holds.

I am also an amateur baker and often spend my free time trying out new recipes.
Oftentimes I succeed, but sometimes things go deeply wrong.
I commiserating with my family who has to taste my pastries but my failed endeavours always encourage me to keep practising and improve the next time.
You can find a selection of my breads/ pastries in the [gallery](gallery).
